# gist upper enterprise ontology

This repository has the raw files that we use to build the release files. If you just want the release files then you can download them from our [website](https://www.semanticarts.com/gist).

## Prerequisites to build the output files

You must have `java` installed for the serializer to work.  See JRE Installation instructions
[here](https://jdk.java.net/). 

## To release (Windows)

To generate a folder suitable for ZIP-ing up and releasing Gist:

1. Make sure you edit `version.txt` and put in the desired version number with 
**no leading nor trailing spaces** 

1. From this folder, run the `bundle.bat` script (double-click or run from command line).  It will
serialize the OWL, and create a ZIP-able folder containing everything needed for a web 
download.  The folder will have a name like `gist8.0.0_webDownload`

1. ZIP up the resulting folder and put it where we host our downloads. 

## Serializer tool

You can also run the `serialize` tool manually to format RDF OWL files to our standard format. 

Examples:

Call it without arguments to show usage, e.g.:

     C:\dev\gist> tools\serialize.bat

     Serialize tool

     usage: serialize somefile.owl
     e.g.: serialize gistAddress.owl


Call it with an argument to serialize the specified file in place (overwrites the file!), e.g.:

     C:\dev\gist> tools\serialize.bat OntologyFiles\gistAddress.owl
     1 file(s) copied.
     serializing OntologyFiles\gistAddress.owl

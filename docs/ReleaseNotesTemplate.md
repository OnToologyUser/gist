Release Notes Template
=====

As noted in the [contributor guidelines](Contributing.md), every PR should include an update to the release notes.  

- Reviewers will reject a PR that does not include an update to the release notes.
- Please follow the heading conventions shown, as the [markdown configuration file](markdownlint.json) dictates the mixed heading style.
- The Motivation/Rationale line for patch changes may be as simple as "Bug fix."
- Each bulleted line should end in a period.
